## Notes on the Project

The AI function makes the AI smart but not impossible to beat. There are still a few paths where the player can win. 

The score is held in the session. Refreshing your browser will reset the score. 

## References
I got the backbone of this code from this tutorial. I polished it, refactored a bit, and commented it to make it my own.
