# CSIS-408
This repo is for the projects for my CSIS 408 at Liberty University Online. Projects 1-3 are stored in this repo. Project 4 has a separate repo because it was cleaner to keep that separated (also, I should have made project 2 a separate repo). 

Below are the instructions given to me for the class. They are a little vague which was good and bad. Good because it gave me some creative freedom in what I built and how I built it. I was allowed to use any technology I wanted. Bad because it was difficult to hit the mark grade wise because there were uncommunicated expectations as to what the apps should include. Overall, it was a good experience. I got to work a little more with Java Spring, and I got to touch on AngularFire and html canvases. 

## Basic Instructions
Each project should include how-to instructions and setup details for the end user (i.e., your
instructor) on how to install, run and test each app, a description of what IDE was used to create
it (with URLs), and each should be thoroughly tested (and verified) with screen shots. Complete
code for each should also be included either in a zip file or in a word document.

NOTE: You will need to do some research on what each application should include in it. To do 
this, download and demo various apps for the particular project you are doing. All apps should
be played as you against the computer (where applicable) and should provide for restarting or
erasing elements. User documentation (as stated in the project instructions) should be provided in
a separate Word document and online to the user. Comments in code will be expected. All
HTML/CSS code should validate. A thorough walkthrough of the code is also required in the
user documentation. Cite ALL sources used.
